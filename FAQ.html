                <p style="padding-bottom:5px;">Distribution of content such as films, TV shows, documentaries, music, etc, through various online platforms is termed as content digital distribution.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">What are the different types of digital platforms?</p>
                <p>Broadly there are 3 types of digital platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>  <strong> &#8226; SVOD - </strong> Subscription Video on Demand service where the platform charges a fixed subscription fee to access the content on it. Platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc fall under this category.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong> &#8226; TVOD -</strong> Transaction Video on Demand service where the viewer can pay to watch (purchase or rent) a specific content. Apple TV, Google Play, etc are examples of the same.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong> &#8226; AVOD & FVOD - </strong> Ad supported & Free Video on Demand services where the viewer can watch anything for free in exchange for viewing ads. YouTube, Vimeo, etc fall under this category.
                    </li>
                    </ul>

                </video>
                <p class="ques_text">Which SVOD platforms can Vista India deliver content to?</p>
                <p>Currently, we are working with some of the most Premium platforms like Netflix and Amazon, among others.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">Can we pitch concepts/ideas/screenplay of films, documentaries or episodic content?</p>
                <p>Vista India helps rights owners/producers to license their finished content to multiple digital platforms. For pitching your ideas/concepts, you will have to reach out to the digital platforms on your own.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">What are the different types of SVOD rights for Netflix?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>&#8226; Exclusive:</strong> The content would be available only on Netflix for the agreed license period. The rights owner/ producer cannot publish the same content on any other platform.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>&#8226; Non-exclusive: </strong>Other than Netflix, the content can be made available on other platforms. The producer/ rights owner can go for non-exclusive deals with other platforms.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>&#8226; Exclusive with broadcasters app carve out: </strong>Nowadays, most of the broadcasters go for a combo deal (satellite & digital) while licensing a film. It includes satellite rights for their tv channels and digital rights for their OTT platform. In this case, the producer/ rights owner can go for the option of broadcasters app carve out.</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="ques_text">What is the process to pitch my film to Netflix?</p>
                <p>The whole process takes around 3 to 4 weeks. Netflix is a curated service i.e we will present your film, however they make independent buying decisions.

                    What is the share between me and Vista India?
                </p>
                <p>It is 80:20 of the gross revenue minus deductibles. 80% to the content/rights owner and 20% to Vista India.
                </p>
                <p class="ques_text">
                    What is the content delivery cost for Netflix?
                </p>
                <p>Vista India is an Netflix Preferred Fulfillment Partner (NPFP). We handle the entire packaging and delivery of the content/rights to Netflix. The delivery cost per title is $815.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">
                    What is the payment structure of Netflix?
                </p>
                <p>Netflix remits licensing fees on a quarterly basis, over the entire license period. Below is an example for a better understanding of the Netflix payment structure.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>&#8226; If the start date of the licensing of your film is 1-Jan-2018</li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8226; Licensing  fee: $120,000 (minus delivery cost)</li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8226; Term: 3 years (36 months)</li>            
            <li>&#8226; The payment would be made in 12 quarters (1 year = 4 quarters- 3 years = 12 quarters)</li>
           <br>
            <li>&#8226; Amount paid every quarter: $10,000 (Divide $1,20,000 into 12 equal instalments)</li>
            <br>
            <li>&#8226; Payment cycle: Feb 2018, May 2018, Aug 2018, Oct 2018, -,Oct 2020</li>
            <br>    
            </ul>
            <p>Starting from Feb 2018, Netflix will pay $10,000 every quarter to Vista India. Vista India will deduct it’s 20% share i.e $2000 and wire the remaining 80% i.e $8000 to the content/rights owner. This process will be repeated every quarter till Oct 2020. Every quarter the content/ rights owner will receive $8000 in his/her bank account through online transfer from Vista India.</p>
            <p class="ques_text">How do I get my payment?</p>
                <p>The licensing fee is routed through Vista India’s US Bank Account to the content/rights owner’s bank account mentioned in the agreement. The licensing fee is remitted in US Dollars without any withholding taxes.
                </p>
                 <p class="ques_text">
                How long until my movie is online?</p>
                <p>After delivering the assets to Vista India, it goes under QC checks at our end before delivering to Netflix. This process can take around 30 to 45 days depending on the condition of the assets and other factors. After this, Netflix takes around 30 days to make the content live on their platform. So, in total the whole process requires around 60 to 75 days.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">For how many territories can I distribute my content?</p>
                <p>Netflix is currently available worldwide in 190 countries (except China, Syria and North Korea)
                </p>
                <p class="ques_text">After licensing my film to Netflix, can I publish it on other platforms?</p>
                <p>The producer/ rights owner cannot publish the film on any of the AVOD & FVOD platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. But they are free to put out their film on TVOD platforms like Apple TV, Google Play, etc.</p>
                <p class="ques_text">
                    What kind of assets are needed for Netflix?</p>

                    Do I have to sign a contract with Vista India?</p>
                    <p>Yes. We shall forward you our standard Netflix agreement. We will require you to confirm the contents of the Agreement before we pitch your content to Netflix. Furthermore, kindly note that once we receive your confirmation on the draft, no changes shall be made or accepted at a later stage. The only additions made to the draft will be to incorporate the offer details, as and when we receive the same. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, request you to note that we will not be able to send you the counter signed copy of the Agreement right away. The procedure we follow is that once the content partner signs the Agreement, we have the materials called from them and have them checked and approved. Once approved, we deliver the same to Netflix. Upon receiving the approval of the Platform, we counter sign the Agreement and send the content partner's copy across. </p>
                    <p>Stamp duty and other contract related charges are borne by Vista India.</p>

            <p>The time a film goes live online can vary, some of it depends on you, and some of it is outside your control. Once we get all your assets, we start the ingest process. Our typical turnaround time is 4 weeks of finalizing the content and delivering it to the service. At this point, the platform will review the content with their own teams. This can take anywhere from 7 to 10 days. If the content is accepted, it will then go live, depending on how accurate the information and assets are to the technical necessities.</p>
            <p class="ques_text">Do I have to sign a contract with Vista India?</p>
            <p>Yes. Depending on the platform you want your content to be featured, we shall forward you our standard contract. Once you approve it, we shall have the documents franked. Two copies would be sent to you with our signatures. You would need to sign both the copies, retain one and return the other to Vista India.</p>
