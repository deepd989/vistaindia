                    <p class="blog_content">Bengaluru-based Guhesh Ramanathan, cofounder of Excubator, terribly missed his daily commute of the pre-Covid world.


                        Starting at 8:30 am, he would carpool for his 75-minute journey between Kengeri on Mysore Road to his office in HSR Layout. “It was great for socialising and helped me ease into office mode,” he recalls. On the way, he would chat with his fellow travellers, brainstorm new ideas and discuss business issues like how to close deals, bag clients, or hire new talent.</p>

                    <p class="blog_content">With work from home (WFH), all that was over,” he says. There was no break time. “At home, I was just jumping from one call to another.” As soon as the unlock began, he resumed work from office and his daily commute. “I missed it badly,” he says.

                        </p>
                        <p class="blog_content">His wife, Nalini Guhesh, a data analytics executive, is a picture in contrast. “I am relishing WFH,” she says. Her 90-minute office commute to Old Airport Road had three legs — a car drive to the metro station, a metro ride to MG Road and an auto-rickshaw ride to cover the last mile. “It was very tiring. I don’t miss it at all,” she says. She intends to largely WFH in future.</p>

                    <p class="blog_content">Between Guhesh and Nalini lies an entire spectrum of the joy and angst of the office commute. The choices people make going forward will have significant implications. As the pandemic holds sway and the fear of infection still has us in its grip, social distancing norms will have an overriding influence on consumers and policymakers globally even as the economy and workplaces inch back to normalcy.</p>
                    <p class="blog_content">  Office-goers’ commute decision will shape the fortunes of many sectors — from metro rail to buses, from cars to bicycles to ride-hailing companies.</p>    
                   <p class="blog_content"> “We are not earning a single paisa,” says Mangu Singh, MD, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). This predicament is shared by many public transport operators not just in India but across the world.</p>

                                        About 13 years ago I made a mistake in a column written for this newspaper. In the hierarchy of errors, it wasn’t a major one, but it was embarrassing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="blog_content">
                                        I said daylight saving time had begun when it actually had just ended. And making matters worse, it was in the opening paragraph. A correction had to be written and affixed to the bottom of the article, where it will remain for as long as the article exists. I was deeply annoyed with myself.
                                    </p>

                                        As I sat there a few days later ruminating about the correction and my self-directed anger, I began to wonder why so many of us hate our mistakes so much. While we may be told early in life that mistakes are OK and we can learn from them, we quickly discover the opposite — that we won’t be lauded for messing up, but admonished.

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="blog_content">
                                        When and why does this change? Is it universal? And how does the way we think about our mistakes affect our ability to be resilient to the ups and downs of life?

The show is a different kind of travel podcast: It introduces people around the world who are creatively working to make their communities better.</p>
                        <h2>Rough Translation</h2>
                        <p class="blog_content">This podcast promises to “take you places”, and since it debuted in 2017, that is exactly what it delivers. Each episode tells listeners how the same subject can be perceived in different places around the world, like a cultural kaleidoscope of current events.</p>
                        <h2>Ochenta Stories</h2>
                        <p class="blog_content">
                            Ochenta Stories’ is a globally crowdsourced show that cobbles together dispatches from a planet in quarantine. Each episode is a different audio-maker’s answer to this question: “What do you want to hear after this pandemic is over?” And those who enjoy immersion language learning will love how each story is retold in each episode, but in another language. Listeners meet an 11-year-old in Asheville, North Carolina, US, envisioning her first day back to school (told in English and Spanish); a Londoner fantasising about the feeling of getting lost in a crowd again (told in English and French); and a couple in Milan who can’t believe how much quarantine time is spent washing one’s own dishes (Italian and English).

                        Last week, movie-theatre chains that are planning to reopen their multiplexes in July became the subject of a drama of their own making: “Mask Wars.” It was a battle fought in the press and over social media—and the chains blinked. 
                       </p>
                       <p class="blog_content">
                        Adam Aron, the C.E.O. of AMC, announced, on Thursday, in Variety, that, when most of its theatres reopen their doors (in anticipation of the July 24th release of “Mulan” and the July 31st release of “Tenet”), staff would all be required to wear masks.
                       </p>
                       <p class="blog_content">
                        For moviegoers, on the other hand, masks would be optional, because, Aron said, “We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy.” His remarks prompted vehement reactions on social media, and, on Friday, Aron changed his mind, issuing a statement announcing that viewers would be required to wear masks after all. 
                       </p>
                       <p class="blog_content">
                        The Regal chain, which plans to reopen on July 10th, had originally punted the requirement for both employees and patrons to local laws, but, following AMC’s shift, also changed its policy to require the wearing of masks by staff and viewers alike.
                       </p>
                       <p class="blog_content">
                        Cinemark will not be requiring viewers to wear masks. None of the three chains will be taking customers’ temperatures at the door unless local guidelines mandate it.
