    How we use the information we collect:
    
    </p>
    <p>Vista may use personally identifiable information about you for the following purposes: (i) to establish or maintain our relationship with you; (ii) to contact you and respond to your requests and inquiries; (iii) to provide you with services you have requested; (iv) to keep you informed of products and services we think may be of interest to you; (v) to personalize your experience with us and to assist you while you use the Sites; (vi) for business administration, including statistical analysis; (vii) to improve the Sites by helping us understand who uses the Sites; and (viii) for fraud prevention and detection and to comply with applicable laws, regulations or codes of practice.

    Security:
    
    </p>
    <p>Vista seeks to adopt appropriate physical, technological and organizational security measures that are consistent with industry practice in order to assist with protection against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information that is under our control. Unfortunately, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You provide all such information entirely AT YOUR OWN RISK. Vista retains personally identifiable information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which such personally identifiable information was collected and in compliance with applicable laws.
